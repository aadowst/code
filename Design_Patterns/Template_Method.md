Template method uses inheritance of an abstract class to set common behavior amoung concrete implementations
The abstract class has a template method, which contains one or more generic methods (called primitive operations), which is/are called by a template method. The primitive operations can be abstract or have default code that could be overridden when implemented in the concrete classes. In the case that the primitive operations are abstract, all of the implementation details of the primitive operations are added in the concrete classes that extend the template class. If the primitive operations are concrete, they are referred to as hooks.
The hooks should be declared as protected, so they can be extended into the concrete child classes, but not callable from other classes
