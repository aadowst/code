A context is the main class that uses a strategy interface. There are concrete strategies that implement the interface.
For example, an image storage class might call compress() and apply() methods from compressor and filter interfaces. Multiple concrete strategies would implement the interfaces (e.g. jpgcompressor and pngcompressor for the former and black-and-white-filter and highcontrastfilter for the latter)
The structure of the strategy pattern is similar to the state pattern. However, in the state pattern, there is a single state that is represented by a subclass of the state interaface. In the strategy pattern, there is not a single state. Different behaviors are represented by different strategy objects. In other words, the behaviors can be mixed and matched (vs. in the state pattern, in which once a subclass is chosen, there is only one set of behaviors)
